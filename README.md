Version: 1.0

Adds more useful drugs to the game.

(Will probably need a bit of balancing so I would love feedback!)

Drugs+ adds 4 new medical type drugs, and are intended to help make living on the rim a bit easier. Those drugs include:

#  Cyludapam: 
 A drug for greatly decreasing a persons motor skills.

#  Hypomorphone: 
 A drug for greatly reducing pain.

#  Tristapram: 
 A drug for greatly improving a persons mood.

#  Flux: 
 A outstandingly powerful drug used mainly on glitterworlds, said to be the perfect form of Luciferium.

All four drugs have to be researched and then can be crafted at a drug lab.
